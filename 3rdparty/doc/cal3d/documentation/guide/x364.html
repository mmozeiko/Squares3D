>      In the Cal3D library, a core material is composed from the color components
      (ambient, diffuse and specular), a shininess factor and several maps, most
      likely texture-maps. All possible materials for a model type are stored in the
      core model according to the shared-data concept.
    </P
><P
>      A simple mechanism for material handling is implemented, which provides an easy
      way to change materials and therefore the look of a model instance. For each
      core model there exists one or more material sets. Materials in the same set
      share a common look, as example 'skin', 'leather' or 'chain-mail'. Additionally
      there are one or more material threads in the core model. These material threads
      contain the same materials but grouped by a specific part of the model, as
      example 'left foot', 'torso' or 'helmet'. Together they build a material grid
      that defines a material for each material set/thread pair.
    </P
><P
>      As described in <A
HREF="x374.html"
><I
>Meshes and Submeshes</I
></A
>,
      every part of the core model (every submesh to be more exact) has a material
      thread assigned. You can now very easily change the look of a model instance,
      by simply select a new current material set for its parts. The Cal3D library is
      now able to look up the material in the material grid with the given new material
      set and the material thread stored in the core model parts.

>        After uncountable battles against evil creatures, our paladin's suit of armor
        has a scratch here and there. In other words, it is time for a visit at the
        local smith for a new outfit. For simplicity let's assume that the paladin model
        is built from two pieces only, the upper body and the lower body. Each of them
        has a different material thread assigned. The smith sells two types of armor,
        the first is chain-mail, the other plate-mail. There is an upper body piece and a
        lower body piece for both armor types. All the pieces of the same armor type
        are in the same material set. The material grid for this example has therefore
        4 entries (2 sets x 2 threads) filled with the materials: upper body chain-mail,
        lower body chain-mail, upper body plate-mail, lower body plate-mail. Now, when the
        paladin tries on the pieces of armor, you can simple select the appropriate
        material set for the body part to change the look of the model. As example, in
        pseudo-code 'change upper body to plate-mail'.
      </P

>      The advantage of this simple material system is that you do not have to handle
      the individual materials themselves. You select the more high-level material
      set which is the same for all body parts. The material system does the low-level
      assignment of the materials of the selected material set to the body parts.
