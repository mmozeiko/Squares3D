Available:
==========

Implement NewtonMaterial properties in collisions between TreeCollision faces.
Implement default Property attributes in xml file.
Allow Property attributes be optional (in xml file).
Get rid of hacks - Invisible wall in level.cpp, cullfacing in skybox.cpp and game.cpp
Make AI players smarter.
Port coach class and name it "Referee".
Use materials on collisions.
Fix shader lighting position.
Cleanup Material class, move to video.
Implement correctly loading shaders from level.xml file.
Fix camera movement speed.
Cleanup begin/end, enable/disable methods in video, make it somehow simplier.
Implement shadows.
Split large polygon rendering (ex. cubes) into smaller polygons. May need restructuring collision type="tree" face loading. Needed for correct lightning.
Implement menu system.
Network?? (vajag precîzâku tâskiòu ðeit).
Fill menu system with Options/Multiplayer/Credits/Rules and some other menus you can think of (which are reasonable).
Add sounds to collision events in world.
Build some nice scenery around game field (like houses, some roads, etc.).
Implement model loading.
Implement nice grass objects and maybe some bushes or even trees (trees are probably be made like models).
Implement model animation.
Implement game Scoreboard.
Implement score counting system.
Implement basic moves for player, kicking the ball, joggling the ball in air, hitting it with head..
Implement basic tournament gameplay.
Upgrade the ball control to be more submissive to player actions.
Add a referee model who whistles when a fault is detected. (optional task)
Look for TODOs, FIXMEs.
